    <h2> My Mural works</h2>
    <p>This art piece was one of my favorites not only because of the details but the palette.<br>  
      I went to a high school called Huron Heights, thatâ€™s why I painted the Huron, and the 
      label has that pun. </p>

    <h1> About Me and Murals</h1>
    <p>I've been exploring all areas of art for as long as I can remember. Though, I began my 
      journey in mural art around three years ago and have since participated in, led, and 
      directed numerous mural projects.  
      With a strong foundation of experience and an unwavering passion for art, I specialize 
      in creating vibrant, dynamic murals that transform spaces. Whether you're looking to 
      elevate your business, make a bold statement, or personalize your home, I am 
      dedicated to bringing your vision to life with creativity and precision. </p>

    <p>I went to an art high school, so this piece was dedicated to the different majors. It was 
      hung up in the front foyer of my high school.</p>

    <p>This was one of my murals, the fiery sun took a lot of trial and error to get right. But I 
    love it. My little sister is the one standing next to the painting</p>
