                <h2>My Mural Works</h2>
                <p>This art piece was one of my favorites not only because of the details but the palette.</p>
                <p>I went to a high school called Huron Heights, that’s why I painted the Huron, and the label has that
                    pun.</p>

            <h2>About Me and Murals</h2>
            <p>I’ve been exploring all areas of art for as long as I can remember. Though, I began my journey in mural
                art around three years ago and have since participated in, led, and directed numerous mural projects.

                vibrant, dynamic murals that transform spaces. Whether you're looking to elevate your business, make a
                bold statement, or personalize your home, I am dedicated to bringing your vision to life with creativity
                and precision.</p>

                <p>I went to an art high school, so this piece was dedicated for the different majors.</p>
